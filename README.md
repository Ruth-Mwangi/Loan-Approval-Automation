# Moneza-Loan-Approval-Automation
This is a machine learning project aimed at automating the approval or rejection of loan applications.
## Project Overview

The Loan Approval Automation project aims to develop a machine learning model to automate the loan application process. This model helps in reducing labor costs while minimizing losses due to incorrect decisions.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Ruth-Mwangi/Moneza-Loan-Approval-Automation.git
   ```
2. Create and activate virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install Dependancies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Project Structure
### data
- **raw**: Contains raw data files that are used as the initial input for the project. These files are typically unprocessed and in their original form.
- **processed**: Contains data files that have been cleaned and processed. These files are the result of data preprocessing steps applied to the raw data.


### notebooks
- **01_data_preprocessing.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing. 
- **02_eda.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **03_model_training.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating machine learning models.
- **04_threshold_optimization.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for determining the optimal probability thresholds for model predictions to balance between different performance metrics.
- **05_business_impact_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing the business impact of the model. This includes evaluating how the modelâ€™s predictions affect business metrics and decisions.

### src
Contains common functions.

### models
Contains the saved models

### reports
- **figures**: Directory for storing visualizations and figures used in reports. It includes plots, charts, and other graphical representations of the data.
